                        Can my team participate as both a builder and a breaker?
                    <dd class="answer">
                        Yes. When your team signs up for a contest, your team is automatically signed up as a builder and a breaker. Your builder and breaker scores are independent though, so you can choose to participate as a builder, a breaker, or both.
